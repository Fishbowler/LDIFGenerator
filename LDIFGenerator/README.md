# LDIF Generator
A GUI for generating random, fictitious, LDIF records that can be imported into LDAP server or other applications for testing.

## Building

`./gradlew build` will produce a ZIP and a TAR that contain the compiled application, all dependent libraries, the `Data` directory, a `README` and scripts for unix and Windows to start the program. The archives are in `build/distributions`.
